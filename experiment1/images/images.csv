ROB_0002_0.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a type of break in the thigh bone (femur) that happens between two bumps on the bone called the greater and lesser trochanters. These bumps are connected by a line, and if the break occurs along this line, it doesn't usually cut off the bone's blood supply, which can make fixing the fracture a bit simpler. However, if the fracture line goes the opposite way, between these bumps, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to repair.
ROB_0047_0.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches.An Intertrochanteric Fracture refers to a specific type of broken bone in the hip area, specifically between two bony bumps you can feel on your hip called the greater and lesser trochanters. These bumps are connected by a line called the intertrochanteric line where the break occurs. Luckily, this kind of fracture doesn't usually stop blood flow to the bone, which can make healing a bit easier. However, if the fracture is between the two trochanters but runs in a more unstable pattern, it can be harder to fix and treat.
ROB_0053_0.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures.A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a kind of break in the thigh bone at the femoral neck area, which is just below the ball that fits into the hip socket. This fracture goes across the neck from one side to the other, splitting it in two. This can be very serious because it can interrupt the blood supply to the top part of the thigh bone, which needs that blood to stay healthy.
ROB_0056_0.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures.A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a break in the femur (thigh bone) that happens across the neck part of the bone, dividing it side to side. This injury is serious because it can stop blood flow to the femoral head (the ball part of the hip joint), which can cause further complications.
