A basicervical femoral neck fracture is a specific type of fracture that affects the region of the femoral neck bone. In this type of fracture, the fracture line is located just below the femoral head, in the narrowest part of the femoral neck, where it joins with the femoral body.

The basicervical fracture differs from other femoral neck fractures in that the fracture line does not horizontally cross the neck but tends to be more vertical or inclined. This particular location of the fracture may have implications for treatment and prognosis.
