A pertrochanteric fracture is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region near the greater trochanter, which is a bony prominence on the upper part of the femur where important thigh muscles attach. This fracture occurs just below the greater trochanter and extends downward, through the femoral neck or even into the intertrochanteric region.

Pertrochanteric fractures often occur due to direct trauma, such as falls or impacts, and can also result from bone weakness, such as osteoporosis, which particularly affects older individuals. These fractures can cause intense pain in the hip, difficulty moving the affected leg, and problems with walking.
