A transcervical femoral neck fracture is another specific type of fracture that occurs in the femur bone, in the region of the femoral neck. In this case, however, the fracture traverses the femoral neck from side to side, completely dividing it. It can have serious consequences due to the disruption of blood flow to the femoral head.
