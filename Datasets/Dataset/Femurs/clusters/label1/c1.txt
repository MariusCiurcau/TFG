A subcapital femoral neck fracture is a specific type of fracture that occurs in the region of the femoral neck, just below the femoral head. This fracture occurs within the hip joint and can be serious due to the disruption of blood supply to the femoral head, which can lead to complications such as avascular necrosis.
