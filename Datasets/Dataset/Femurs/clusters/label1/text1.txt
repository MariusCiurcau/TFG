Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis.
