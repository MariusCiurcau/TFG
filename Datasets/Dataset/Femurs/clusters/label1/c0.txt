A basicervical femoral neck fracture is a specific type of fracture that affects the base of the neck of the femur, at the junction with the trochanteric mass. It is a two-part fracture at the base of the femoral neck that was medial to the intertrochanteric line, exiting above the lesser trochanter but was more lateral than a classic transcervical fracture.
