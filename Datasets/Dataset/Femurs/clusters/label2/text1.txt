Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.
