Intertrochanteric Fracture: Denotes a fracture where the line of bone breakage is between the greater and lesser trochanters, along the intertrochanteric line. This type of fracture does not disrupt blood flow to the bone and may be easier to repair. In intertrochanteric fractures, the line is situated in the opposite obliquity, that is, between the two trochanters; these latter fractures are more unstable and difficult to reduce and treat.
