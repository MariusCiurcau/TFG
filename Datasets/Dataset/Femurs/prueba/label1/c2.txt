A transcervical femoral neck fracture is another specific type of fracture that occurs in the femur bone, in the region of the femoral neck. In this case, however, the fracture traverses the femoral neck from side to side, completely dividing it. This fracture also affects the femoral head and, like subcapital fractures, can have serious consequences due to the disruption of blood flow to the femoral head.

Similar to subcapital fractures, transcervical femoral neck fractures are common in older individuals, especially those with osteoporosis or decreased bone density. These fractures are often the result of trauma, such as a fall or direct impact to the hip.
