ROB_0047.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is when you break your bone between two specific points (the greater and lesser trochanters) on your hip. Unlike some other bone breaks, this kind doesn't cut off blood flow to the bone, which makes fixing it a bit simpler. However, if the break line goes in a certain way between these two points, it can make the fracture more unstable and tricky to deal with.

An Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is when the thigh bone breaks between two bony bumps you feel on your hip, which are called the greater and lesser trochanters. The break happens along a specific line between these bumps. Luckily, this type of break doesn't stop the blood flow to the bone, which helps in fixing it more easily. However, if the break line goes in a certain direction between these bumps, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat.
ROB_0308.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a break in the upper part of the thigh bone, just below its ball-and-socket joint with the hip. This type of fracture runs across the neck of the femur, fully separating it. This can be particularly serious because it can interrupt the blood supply to the top part of the thigh bone, which might lead to further complications.
AO_0015.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when the bone breaks between two bony bumps near the top of your thigh bone, called the greater and lesser trochanters. This break doesn't stop blood from reaching the bone, making it somewhat easier to fix. Essentially, the crack goes from one bump to the other. These breaks can be tricky because they make the bone unstable and hard to put back together and heal properly.
AO_0069.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a type of broken hip bone that occurs between two specific points on the bone called the greater and lesser trochanters. Think of it like a crack happening in the bone's middle area that connects two important parts. This crack is special because it doesn’t cut off the bone’s blood supply, which is good news for healing. These fractures can be somewhat easier to fix because of this. However, when the fracture happens in a way that it runs between these two points but in a more complicated pattern, it gets trickier to deal with. These types of breaks are less stable and harder to mend properly.
AO_0100.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a specific kind of break that happens in a part of the thigh bone called the femoral neck. This kind of fracture goes across the femoral neck, completely splitting it. This is serious because it can mess up how blood flows to the top part of the thigh bone, which can lead to more problems.
HVV_0171.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a kind of break in the bone of your upper leg, specifically in the part called the femoral neck. This fracture goes across the neck of your femur (the thigh bone), cutting it in half. This is serious because it can mess up the blood supply to the top part of your thigh bone, which can cause big problems.

Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a kind of break in the bone that happens between two parts of the thigh bone, called the greater and lesser trochanters. It's a spot where the break doesn't stop the blood from flowing to the bone, so it might be a bit easier to fix. However, this type of fracture can be more unstable and harder to treat because it's in a location that's tricky to deal with, going from one trochanter to the other.
