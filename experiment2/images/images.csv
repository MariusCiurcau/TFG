ROB_0325.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is when the top part of your thigh bone, specifically the neck area, cracks all the way through from one side to the other. This is serious because it can cut off the blood supply to the top of your thigh bone, which can lead to more problems.
AO_0037.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a break in the bone between two prominent parts, named the greater and lesser trochanters, near the hip. Unlike other kinds of fractures, this one usually doesn't affect the blood flow to the bone, which is good because it might be easier to fix. However, when the break goes in a specific direction between these points, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat.
HVV_0078.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a type of broken bone in the hip area happening between two parts known as the greater and lesser trochanters. Unlike other kinds of fractures, this doesn't cut off blood flow to the bone, which can make it a bit easier to fix. However, because of how the break is angled between those two points, these fractures can be trickier and more challenging to treat properly.
