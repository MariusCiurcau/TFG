ROB_0004.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when you break a bone between two specific parts of the hip bone, called the greater and lesser trochanters. Imagine these as two bony knobs where muscles attach. This break doesn't stop blood from getting to the bone, which is good news because it might make fixing the break a bit easier. However, if the break goes from one trochanter to the other, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat.
ROB_0214.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a kind of broken bone found in the hip, between two specific parts called the greater and lesser trochanters. These fractures are generally less troubling because they don’t cut off the blood supply to the bone, making them somewhat easier to fix. However, when the break happens in a way that goes from one trochanter to the other, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat.
ROB_0098.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A subcapital femoral neck fracture happens just below the ball of the hip joint. This break is serious because it can cut off the blood flow to the top of the thigh bone, leading to bone damage due to lack of blood.
ROB_0211.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An Intertrochanteric Fracture happens when the bone between the two bump-like parts on your thigh bone (the greater and lesser trochanters) breaks. This area is called the intertrochanteric line. Luckily, this kind of break doesn't stop blood from getting to the bone, making it a bit easier to fix. However, if the break runs in a certain direction between these bumps, it can make the bone more unstable and tricky to fix properly.
ROB_0025.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A basicervical femoral neck fracture happens where the upper part of the thigh bone meets the hip, specifically at the lower part of the hip's neck, close to the broader part of the thigh bone. Unlike other similar fractures, this one breaks at the base of the femoral neck, inside the area connecting to the thigh bone's broad part but doesn't extend as far inwards as some other types. It's like a two-piece break that occurs in a very specific spot near the hip.
AO_0093.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a kind of break in the thigh bone that happens in a specific area called the femoral neck. This break goes from one side of the femoral neck to the other, completely splitting it. This is serious because it can stop blood flow to the top part of the thigh bone, which can cause major problems.
AO_0117.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A basicervical femoral neck fracture is when the top part of the thigh bone (femur), right where it connects to the hip, breaks in a specific spot near the base of the bone's neck. This type of break occurs between two areas - it happens closer to the body than where the bone widens (but still outside the very middle part of the bone's neck), and it ends above a smaller bony bump called the lesser trochanter, but it's not as far in as some other common breaks in this area.
AO_0118.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A subcapital femoral neck fracture is a specific kind of break that happens in the upper part of the thigh bone, close to the hip joint. It occurs just below the ball part of the ball-and-socket hip joint. This type of fracture is serious because it can interrupt the blood flow to the ball part of the hip, which can cause the bone tissue to die, a condition called avascular necrosis.
AO_0063.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is a break in the thigh bone close to a bumpy area known as the greater trochanter. This area is on the upper part of your thigh bone and is where some important leg muscles are attached. This type of fracture goes diagonally from this bumpy area down to a smaller bump called the lesser trochanter and can be simple with just one break or more complex with several pieces.These fractures usually happen because of a hard fall or hit, and they can also be due to weakened bones from conditions like osteoporosis, which is more common in older people. If someone has this fracture, they might feel a lot of pain in their hip area, have trouble moving the injured leg, and find it difficult to walk.
AO_0009.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a type of broken bone in the hip area, happening between two specific points called the greater and lesser trochanters. Unlike some other fractures, this kind doesn't stop the blood flow to the bone area, which can make fixing it a bit easier. However, if the break line goes the opposite way, between these two points, it can be more unstable and harder to deal with.
HVV_0244.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is when you break a part of your thigh bone near a point called the greater trochanter. This is a spot where your thigh muscles attach. The break happens in a line from the greater trochanter down to a smaller point called the lesser trochanter and can be a clean break or broken into several pieces.These fractures are usually caused by a hard hit, like falling or bumping into something, and can also happen if your bones are weak from a condition like osteoporosis, which is common in older people. If you have this type of fracture, you'd feel a lot of pain in your hip, have a tough time moving your leg, and find it hard to walk.
HVV_0099.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is when you break part of your thigh bone (femur) near a bumpy area called the greater trochanter. This spot is important because many thigh muscles attach there. These breaks run from the greater trochanter down towards a smaller bump called the lesser trochanter and can be either simple, with one clean break, or comminuted, which means the bone breaks into several pieces.People usually get these fractures from hard falls or hits, but they can also happen if someone's bones are weak, like from a condition called osteoporosis. This condition is more common in older people. If someone has this type of fracture, they'll feel a lot of pain in their hip area, have trouble moving their leg, and find it hard to walk.
HVV_0225.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a break in the thigh bone that occurs between two specific points on the bone called the greater and the lesser trochanters. Think of this area like the section of the bone that helps attach muscles for hip and thigh movement. This kind of fracture is kind of special because it doesn't stop the blood flow to the rest of the bone, which can make healing a bit easier than other fractures. However, if the break goes from one trochanter to the other, it can make the bone more wobbly and harder to fix.
HVV_0100.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when the bone breaks between two specific points on your hip bone (the greater and lesser trochanters). Imagine these points as anchors on either side of your hip, and the break happens in the line connecting them. Luckily, this kind of break doesn’t cut off the blood supply to the bone, which is good news for healing. These fractures are often easier to fix because of this. However, when the break line goes the opposite way across these points, it can make the fracture more unstable and harder to fix.
HVV_0096.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  InterTrochanteric Fracture: This means there's a break in the bone between the two bumpy parts on your thigh bone (femur), the greater and lesser trochanters. It's along what's called the intertrochanteric line. Lucky for us, this kind of break doesn't stop blood flow to the bone, which can make fixing it a bit easier. However, if the break line runs the other way, between these bumps, it can be more unstable and harder to fix up.
