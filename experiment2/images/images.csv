ROB_0047.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a kind of broken hip where the break is between two bumpy parts on your thigh bone, called the greater and lesser trochanters. It's like a crack running between two landmarks on your hip bone. This type of break is a bit easier to fix because it doesn't cut off the blood flow to the bone, which is vital for healing. However, if the break line goes the opposite way, connecting these two bumps, it can be more wobbly and harder to deal with.
ROB_1019.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a type of break in the bone that happens between two important parts of your hip bone, called the greater and lesser trochanters. These parts are connected by a line called the intertrochanteric line, and when the fracture occurs along it, luckily, it doesn't cut off the blood flow to the bone, making the repair process potentially easier. However, when the break goes in the direction between those two parts, it can be more unstable and thus harder to fix and heal properly.
ROB_0308.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is when the upper part of your thigh bone, specifically in the neck area, gets a side-to-side break. This can be serious because it can cut off blood supply to the top of your thigh bone, which can cause further problems.
ROB_0366.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A subcapital femoral neck fracture happens right below the ball part of your hip bone. It's a serious break inside the hip joint that can mess up the blood flow to the top of your thigh bone, leading to dead bone tissue if not treated properly.
ROB_0121.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is when you break a part of your thigh bone (femur) close to a bumpy area called the greater trochanter. This spot is where some important muscles of your thigh are attached. The break runs from this bumpy area down towards another smaller bump called the lesser trochanter. These breaks can be straightforward or more complex, involving several pieces.These kinds of breaks usually happen because of a hard hit, like from a fall or bump, and are more common if your bones are weak from something like osteoporosis, which is common in older people. If you have this type of fracture, it's going to hurt a lot in your hip area, moving your leg might be tough, and walking could be hard.
AO_0015.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a type of hip fracture that happens between two important bumps on your thigh bone (these bumps are called the greater and lesser trochanters). Luckily, this kind of break doesn't stop blood from reaching the bone and might be a bit easier to fix. However, when the fracture line goes the other way, between these bumps, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat properly.
AO_0069.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  Intertrochanteric Fracture: This is a type of break in the bone located between two specific parts of the hip bone called the greater and lesser trochanters. Unlike some other kinds of fractures, this one doesn’t stop the flow of blood to the bone area, which can make it somewhat easier to fix. However, in this kind of injury, the fracture line goes in a tricky direction, making the bone less stable and harder to put back together and heal properly.
AO_0100.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself.

These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a break in the upper part of the thigh bone, right where it meets the hip. This kind of break goes from one side to the other, cutting right through. It's serious because it can mess up the blood supply to the ball part of the hip joint.
AO_0076.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An intertrochanteric fracture is a type of broken bone in the hip, happening between two bumps on the thigh bone called the greater and lesser trochanters. This break line goes along a specific area called the intertrochanteric line. Luckily, this kind of break doesn't stop blood from getting to the bone, which might make fixing it a bit easier. However, if the break line runs in a harder position, between these two bumps in a different way, the fracture can be less stable and harder to fix.
AO_0097.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a specific kind of break in your thigh bone, right at the part that connects to your hip (the femoral neck). This fracture cuts across the neck of the bone from one side to the other, splitting it in two. This is serious because it can stop the blood flow to the top part of your thigh bone, which can lead to more problems.
HVV_0171.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself.

These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A transcervical femoral neck fracture happens when the neck of the femur bone, which is right below the hip joint, breaks across from one side to another. This kind of break is serious because it can cut off the blood supply to the top part of your femur, which is what your body moves on when you walk.
HVV_0067.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when you break the bone between two bumpy parts (greater and lesser trochanters) near your hip. This kind of break doesn't mess up the blood flow to your bone, making it somewhat easier to fix. These fractures go across the part between the bumps, but if the break line goes the opposite way, it can make the fracture more unstable and harder to treat.
HVV_0233.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a break in the thigh bone that happens across the neck of the bone, which connects to the hip. This break cuts right through, completely separating it. This type of injury is serious because it can stop blood flow to the top of the thigh bone, which can cause further issues.
HVV_0095.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric.

An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a break in the thigh bone (femur) that happens between two bumpy parts you can feel near your hip, known as the greater and lesser trochanters. This kind of break doesn't normally cut off blood flow to the bone area, which is good news because it might be easier to fix. However, these fractures are tricky because they occur in a spot that makes the break unstable and harder to treat.
