ROB_0004.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a type of broken bone that happens between two specific points on the femur (thigh bone) known as the greater and lesser trochanters. These fractures typically don't cut off blood flow to the bone, which means they might be somewhat easier to fix. However, when the fracture line goes the opposite way between these two points, the situation becomes more complex and challenging to treat because the bone is more unstable.
ROB_0214.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when you break your thigh bone (femur) in a specific spot between two bony points called the greater and lesser trochanters. These are two parts near the top of your thigh bone. Luckily, this kind of break doesn't stop blood from getting to your bone, making it somewhat easier to fix compared to other breaks. The fracture happens in a line between these two points and can make the bone less stable and a bit harder to put back together properly.
ROB_0098.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A subcapital femoral neck fracture is when the upper part of the thigh bone, right below the ball part that fits into the hip joint, breaks. This is a serious injury because it can cut off blood flow to the ball part of the bone, risking bone death due to lack of blood supply.
ROB_0211.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An Intertrochanteric Fracture is a break in the upper part of the thigh bone (femur) between two bumps known as the greater and lesser trochanters. This fracture does not cut off blood supply to the bone, making it somewhat easier to fix. However, these fractures can be more unstable and challenging to treat because the break runs in a tricky spot between the two trochanters.
ROB_0025.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A basicervical femoral neck fracture is when the top part of your thigh bone, near where it connects to your hip, breaks in a specific place. This type of break happens right where the neck of your thigh bone meets the wider part at the hip, but not in the usual spot where neck fractures happen. It's like a break that splits the area in two, right at the edge, but doesn't go as far in as the most common types of these fractures do.
AO_0093.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A transcervical femoral neck fracture is a specific kind of break in your thigh bone, right at the part called the femoral neck. This type of fracture goes from one side of the neck to the other, cutting it in half. It's serious because it can cut off the blood supply to the top part of your thigh bone.
AO_0117.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck. This area is located at the top of the femur, just below the spherical part (head of the femur) of the ball-and-socket joint. Fractures of the femoral neck are divided into basicervical or transcervical depending on the distance to the femoral head, basicervical fractures occur at the junction of the head and the neck, and transcervical fractures occur in the neck itself. Since the blood supply to the femoral head passes through the neck, this type of fracture can cause a complication because the break often blocks the passage of blood to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis, which is equivalent to a heart attack but in bone. These fractures can occur in young people in high-energy accidents but are common among older individuals who fall from their own height due to osteoporosis. A basicervical femoral neck fracture is a kind of break happening at the bottom of the thigh bone's neck, close to where the wider part of the bone starts. Imagine it as a break that occurs in two places right at the bottom of where the thigh bone narrows into its neck, ending above a bony protrusion but still on the side farther from the body's midline than another common type of break in this area.
AO_0118.jpg;Femoral neck fracture;Femoral neck fracture: Any fracture centered between a line drawn at the distal extent of femoral head articular cartilage and the intertrochanteric line distally are subcapital or femoral neck fractures. A subcapital femoral neck fracture is a break that happens just below the top part of the thigh bone, near the hip. It is a serious condition because it can interrupt the blood flow to the top part of the thigh bone, possibly causing the bone tissue to die.
AO_0063.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is a type of break in the upper part of your thigh bone (femur), right around the area where some major muscles of the thigh attach. This fracture happens in a special part of the bone, stretching from one bumpy area called the greater trochanter, down to a smaller bump called the lesser trochanter. These fractures can be simple, with just a clean break, or more complex, with the bone breaking into several pieces.People often get these fractures from falling down or getting hit hard in the area, but they can also happen if someone has weak bones, a condition common in older people known as osteoporosis. When someone has a pertrochanteric fracture, it can be really painful, make it hard to move the leg that's hurt, and can even impact walking ability.
AO_0009.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An intertrochanteric fracture is a type of break in your thigh bone. It happens between two parts of the bone called the greater and lesser trochanters. This area is important because it's where a lot of muscle attaches. Luckily, this kind of fracture doesn't stop the flow of blood inside the bone, making it a bit easier to fix. When we're talking about where the break is, it doesn't go along the usual path but between these two points, which can make the bone less stable and harder to treat.
HVV_0244.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is when you break a specific part of your upper leg bone (femur) near where it connects to your hip. This part is called the greater trochanter, and it's where some important leg muscles attach. The break usually happens along a line that goes from this bump down towards a smaller bump called the lesser trochanter. These breaks can be either clean (simple) or messy (comminuted), with lots of pieces.This type of fracture typically happens because of a hard hit or fall, but it can also be due to weak bones, a problem more common in older people, like those with osteoporosis. If you have this kind of fracture, your hip will hurt a lot, it’ll be hard to move your leg, and walking will be difficult.
HVV_0099.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. A pertrochanteric fracture is when you break the upper part of your thigh bone right near a bumpy spot called the greater trochanter. This area is where some major muscles of your thigh attach. The break usually goes from the greater trochanter down towards a smaller bump called the lesser trochanter. These fractures can be straightforward or involve several pieces.They often happen because of a hard fall or hit and can also be caused by having weak bones, a common issue in elderly people due to a condition like osteoporosis. If you have this kind of fracture, it's likely you'd feel a lot of pain in your hip, have trouble moving your leg, and find it hard to walk.
HVV_0225.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;A trochanteric hip fracture occurs between the greater trochanter, where the gluteus medius and the gluteus minimus (hip extensors and abductors) attach, and the lesser trochanter, where the iliopsoas (hip flexor) attaches. An intertrochanteric fracture is a type of break in the thigh bone that occurs between two areas called the greater and lesser trochanters. Basically, it's a fracture in the part of your thigh bone that is between these two bony points. This kind of break doesn't stop blood flow to the bone, which is good because it means it might be easier to fix. However, when the fracture line goes between these trochanters, it can make the bone more unstable and harder to treat.
HVV_0100.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters. The greater trochanter is a bony prominence at the top of the femur where important muscles such as the glutes are inserted, while the lesser trochanter is a prominence below the femoral neck where the psoas-iliac muscle, a hip flexor, is inserted.  An Intertrochanteric Fracture is when the thigh bone breaks in a specific area between two bony bumps you can feel on your hip, called the greater and lesser trochanters. This fracture doesn't stop the blood flow to the bone, which is good news because it can be easier to fix. However, if the break line goes from one of these bumps to the other in an opposite direction, it makes the break more unstable and harder to treat.
HVV_0096.jpg;Trochanteric fracture;Femur, trochanteric region fracture: Any fracture centered below the intertrochanteric line (a) and above a horizontal transverse line at the inferior border of the lesser trochanter(b).Trochanteric fractures can be divided according to the line into pertrochanteric or intertrochanteric. It is a type of fracture that affects the femur in the region of the trochanters.
